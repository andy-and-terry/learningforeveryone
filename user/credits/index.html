	<h1>Credits</h1>
	<hr>
	<section id="credits">
	<p>
This document serves as the official credits, acknowledgements, explanatory notes,
contextual background, and general disclosure statement for this platform.
</p>

<p>
The length of this credits section is intentional. It exists to provide transparency,
clarity, and an unambiguous description of the platform’s purpose, design philosophy,
technical implementation, and limitations.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Platform Overview</h2>

<p>
This platform was designed, developed, and maintained as a lightweight, browser-based
homework sharing and information distribution system. Its primary purpose is to provide
a centralized, predictable, and low-friction location where students can view homework
assignments, announcements, and related educational materials.
</p>

<p>
The platform is not designed to function as a learning management system, a social
network, or a monitoring tool. It deliberately avoids complexity in favor of clarity
and reliability.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>

<p>
The design philosophy behind this platform emphasizes restraint and intentional
simplicity. Features are added only when they provide clear value and are avoided when
they introduce unnecessary complexity, maintenance overhead, or cognitive load.
</p>

<p>
The absence of certain features is not accidental. It is a deliberate design choice.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>No homework submission uploads</li>
  <li>No grading or scoring systems</li>
  <li>No automated reminders</li>
  <li>No engagement metrics</li>
  <li>No analytics or tracking</li>
  <li>No behavior monitoring</li>
</ul>

<p>
This platform exists to assist, not to supervise.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Concept and Development</h2>

<p>
The conceptual design, system architecture, and implementation were created by the
platform author. Development followed an iterative approach, with each change evaluated
based on clarity, maintainability, and long-term stability.
</p>

<p>
Rather than relying on complex frameworks or backend infrastructure, the platform was
designed to operate entirely within the constraints of static hosting. This reduces
failure points and simplifies deployment.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Technical Architecture</h2>

<p>
The platform is built using standard web technologies that are widely supported across
modern browsers.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>HTML is used to define structure and content hierarchy.</li>
  <li>CSS is used to manage layout, typography, and visual consistency.</li>
  <li>JavaScript is used for interactivity and dynamic behavior.</li>
</ul>

<p>
All application logic executes on the client side. No server-side code is required for
normal operation.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Hosting and Deployment</h2>

<p>
The platform is hosted using GitHub Pages. This hosting model allows the site to be
served securely over HTTPS without the need for dedicated servers, databases, or
runtime environments.
</p>

<p>
This deployment approach prioritizes reliability, transparency, and ease of
maintenance.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Security Considerations</h2>

<p>
Security within this platform is approached through minimization rather than
escalation. The platform avoids storing sensitive personal information wherever
possible.
</p>

<p>
Login mechanisms exist solely for basic access control and user experience separation.
They are not intended to function as high-security authentication systems.
</p>

<p>
Passwords are processed using salted hashing techniques. Plaintext passwords are never
stored. Salts are generated randomly and stored as required for verification.
</p>

<p>
All security decisions are made with the understanding that client-side code is
inspectable.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>

<p>
This platform does not collect analytics, usage metrics, or behavioral data. No
advertising networks are used. No tracking scripts are embedded.
</p>

<p>
Any data stored locally within the user’s browser is used solely to support basic
session functionality and is not transmitted to external servers.
</p>

<p>
Privacy is preserved by design rather than by policy alone.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Content Responsibility</h2>

<p>
Homework assignments, announcements, and external links displayed on the platform are
provided by teachers or administrators. The platform itself does not generate
educational content.
</p>

<p>
The accuracy, relevance, and appropriateness of posted materials remain the
responsibility of the content providers.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>User Responsibilities</h2>

<p>
Students are responsible for checking assignments, managing deadlines, and completing
work as required. The platform does not enforce compliance.
</p>

<p>
Teachers are responsible for ensuring that posted materials are accurate and clearly
communicated.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<p>
This platform does not provide messaging, file uploads, grading systems, feedback
mechanisms, or progress tracking.
</p>

<p>
These limitations are intentional and reflect the platform’s focused scope.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>
This project acknowledges the broader web development ecosystem, including open web
standards, browser APIs, and publicly available documentation that make projects of this
nature possible.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Maintenance and Updates</h2>

<p>
The platform may be updated, modified, refactored, expanded, reduced, or discontinued
at any time without prior notice.
</p>

<p>
There is no guarantee of long-term availability or feature permanence.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Final Disclaimer</h2>

<p>
This platform is provided on an “as-is” basis. No warranties, guarantees, or assurances
are expressed or implied.
</p>

<p>
By using this platform, users acknowledge its limitations and accept responsibility for
their own actions.
